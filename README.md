# My first project
Welcome!

In this project I have learned to use gitpod to create files and directories in my workspace. In addition, I have learned to make changes in those files and folders and update them accordingly on the local repository,git, by adding and committing them. Furthermore, I have followed some steps from lesson to push those local files to github where I could also generate a web page they can be viewed from for anyone with the link to the page.
